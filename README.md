# Challenge3

üìå Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to develop a Java application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to perform GET requests to the Google Scholar Author API, retrieve academic data, and integrate it into a structured database.

This project emphasizes clean architecture, modular development, and reliability when interacting with external APIs.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Functionalities

API Consumption: Perform GET requests to the Google Scholar Author API.

Error Handling: Manage API errors (timeouts, invalid responses, rate limits).

Pagination Support: Correctly handle paginated responses from the API.

Database Integration: Store retrieved author and publication data in a relational database with a consistent schema.

MVC Design Pattern: Clear separation of responsibilities (Model = database/data objects, View = user interaction, Controller = request/data flow management).

Unit Testing: Ensure reliability of API requests, pagination, and database operations.

Documentation: Provide clear references and technical notes to facilitate maintenance and future extensions.

üåç Project Relevance

This project addresses the challenge of automating the retrieval and organization of academic data.

For researchers: it simplifies data collection from Google Scholar.

For institutions: it helps structure large volumes of publication data for analysis and reporting.

For developers: it serves as a reusable and extensible example of API integration with Java, MVC, and databases.

In short, it facilitates access, storage, and structured use of academic author data.
