# Challenge3
## üìå **Project Purpose**

The main goal of Challenge3 is to develop a Java application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern that retrieves academic data from the Google Scholar Author API via SerpApi, processes the data, and stores it in a structured MySQL database.

This project emphasizes:

- Clean architecture

- Modular development

- Robust API interaction and error handling

It provides a user-friendly GUI for searching academic authors or topics and viewing their publications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Functionalities**

- API Consumption: Performs GET requests to the Google Scholar Author API through SerpApi.

- Error Handling: Manages network errors, invalid responses, and API rate limits.

- Data Parsing: Extracts relevant publication details such as title, authors, year, citation count, and link.

- Database Integration: Stores retrieved data in a MySQL database with a consistent schema, preventing duplicates.

- MVC Design Pattern: Separates concerns clearly:

  - Model ‚Äì represents data (Article class)

  - View ‚Äì handles GUI interactions (ArticleView)

  - Controller ‚Äì manages API requests, data processing, and updates (ArticleController)

- GUI Features: Search field, results table, double-click to open article links.

- Unit Testing Ready: Designed to allow testing of API requests, data parsing, and database persistence.

- Documentation: Fully documented with Javadoc for all classes.

## üåç **Project Relevance**

This application simplifies the retrieval and organization of academic publication data:

- For researchers: Speeds up collection of publication metrics and author data.

- For institutions: Helps structure and analyze large volumes of publication data.

- For developers: Serves as a reusable example of API integration, Java MVC design, and database interaction.

In short, it enables structured access, storage, and usage of Google Scholar data.

## üõ† **Technical Overview**
**Classes**

Model:

- Article ‚Äì represents an academic article, including title, authors, year, citation count, and link.

DAO / Database:

- ArticleD ‚Äì handles saving articles to MySQL, avoids duplicates, and parses citation counts.

- DatabaseManager ‚Äì manages database connection and table initialization.

Controller:

- ArticleController ‚Äì performs API requests, parses JSON responses, updates the database, and passes data to the view.

View:

- ArticleView ‚Äì GUI for user interaction, displays articles in a table, allows opening links.

Main:

- Initializes GUI and binds search functionality.

## **Database Schema**
Table: articles
